bibliography: Tex/ref.bib       # Do not edit: Keep this naming convention and location.
csl: Tex/harvard-stellenbosch-university.csl # referencing format used.
# By default, the bibliography only displays the cited references. If you want to change this, you can comment out one of the following:
#nocite: '@*' # Add all items in bibliography, whether cited or not

linestretch: 1.2                # Set distance between lines.
link-citations: TRUE            # This creates dynamic links to the papers in reference list.

### Adding additional latex packages:

abstract: |
  Abstract to be written here. The abstract should not be too long and should provide the reader with a good understanding what you are writing about. Academic papers are not like novels where you keep the reader in suspense. To be effective in getting others to read your paper, be as open and concise about your findings here as possible. Ideally, upon reading your abstract, the reader should feel he / she must read your paper in entirety.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.

You have been approached by Morningstar to provide insight into industry fund flows between actively managed funds. You recently read Warren Buffetâ€™s 2004 Berkshire Hathaway AGM report that mentioned the high degree of value destruction from investors changing their strategies and allocating to managers based on past performance.

Use your discretion to write a short report where you study the persistence of past performance for local active managers through time; whether there is any truth to the direction of flows toward winners based on past performance (be flexible in the look back period that you consider to identify past winners).

Ultimately, you want to test whether past performance is a good indicator of future performance for active managers, and whether investment flows go predominantly to past winners, and what the performance would have been for strategies that elected to chase winners.
